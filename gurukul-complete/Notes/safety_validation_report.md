# Safety Validation Report - Gurukul Adaptive Layer

## What We Tested

We made sure the adaptive interface is safe and supportive for learners. Here's what passed all our checks:

### Core Safety Features ✓

**One Change at a Time**: Only one visual adaptation happens at once - no overwhelming multiple changes

**Gentle Movements**: All animations take at least 300ms - nothing sudden or jarring

**Natural Fade-Out**: Every adaptation fades away on its own in 4-12 seconds - no permanent changes

**Stress Relief**: When someone seems stressed, the interface gets calmer, not busier
