# Learning Alignment Notes

## What Works (and What Doesn't) for Learning

### Keep These - They Help Learning

**Dwell → Gentle Blue Pulse** (Attention Re-centering)
Trigger: Extended focus on content
Response: Soft pulse without breaking concentration.
Use for: Deep reading, complex problems, moments needing encouragement.

**Backtrack → Breadcrumb Hints** (Navigation Guide)
Trigger: Moving between learning sections repeatedly
Response: Subtle directional cues. Learning isn't linear - people need to jump around.
Use for: Multi-module courses, connecting ideas, "where was that thing?" moments.

**Hover Repeat → Thinking Space** (Hover Relief)
Trigger: Multiple hovers over same choices
Response: Gentle dimming of other options. Honors that good decisions take time.
Use for: Multiple choice, learning paths, any reflection moment.

### Lose These - They Kill Learning

**Undo Loop → "You're Wrong" Flash** (Focus Assist)
Trigger: Repeated undo actions
Response: Bright highlighting suggesting "correct" action
Problem: Turns natural exploration into failure. Learning requires trial and error.

**Fast Action → Speed Rewards** (Quick Combo)
Trigger: Rapid clicking patterns
Response: Flashy acknowledgments for speed
Problem: Learning isn't a race. People click through without reading, skip thinking moments.

**Stress Test → Urgency Pressure**
Trigger: Any perceived slowness
Response: Time pressure cues, acceleration prompts
Problem: Stress shuts down learning. Triggers survival mode, blocks memory formation.

### The Learning Rules

**Whisper, Don't Shout**: Soft blues, subtle pulses. Supportive friend, not impatient teacher.

**Validate, Don't Correct**: "I see you thinking" not "click here."

**One Thing at a Time**: Thinking brains can't handle competing UI changes.

**Honor the Pace**: Some think fast, others deep. Work with natural rhythms.

**When in Doubt, Shut Up**: Better to miss helping than interrupt thinking.

Our system works for learning - we just need to be much more careful about when and how we speak.
