# Calm Design Guidelines

A quiet guide for creating gentle, learning-friendly user experiences.

## Core Principles

- **Gentle pace**: Allow users to move through the experience at their own speed
- **Respectful presence**: Be helpful without being intrusive
- **Learning support**: Create a safe space for exploration and growth
- **Minimal pressure**: Remove urgency and performance anxiety

## 1. Tweak Timings

### Animation Guidelines
- Use slow, smooth animations (300ms+ for most transitions)
- Make all motion predictable and purposeful
- Avoid sudden or flashy transitions that might startle

### Examples
**Good:**
- A gentle fade-in that takes 400ms to complete
- A slide animation that moves content smoothly into place

**Bad:**
- Snappy, jarring transitions that complete in under 100ms
- Flashy effects that grab attention unexpectedly

## 2. Tweak Intensity

### Color Guidelines
- Use muted, low-contrast colors
- Avoid bright highlights or attention-grabbing colors
- Choose soft palettes that feel natural and comfortable

### Motion Guidelines
- Keep motion subtle and minimal
- Avoid confetti, celebration effects, or reward animations
- Focus on functional motion rather than decorative elements

### Examples
**Good:**
- Soft blue notification indicator
- Gentle pulse to indicate new content

**Bad:**
- Bright red blinking alerts
- Confetti animations for completion

## 3. One Adaptation at a Time

### Change Management
- Implement only one UI change at a time
- Avoid stacking multiple hints or visual changes simultaneously
- Allow users to adjust to each change before introducing another

### Examples
**Good:**
- Moving a button to a better location
- Then later, changing the button color if needed

**Bad:**
- Moving the button, changing its color, adding animation, and highlighting it all at once

## 4. Learning-Friendly Tone

### Language Guidelines
- Use supportive, neutral language
- Avoid judgment or criticism in error messages
- Remove urgency indicators or performance pressure

### Examples
**Good:**
- "Take your time to explore this feature"
- "Not quite right? Try again when you're ready"

**Bad:**
- "Hurry up! You're running out of time"
- "Incorrect! Try again"

## Creating Safe Spaces for Learning

- Allow mistakes without penalty
- Provide clear, non-threatening feedback
- Celebrate progress quietly rather than loudly
- Honor different learning paces and styles

## Final Reminder

Design for the user who needs a calm moment, not another source of stimulation. Every element should ask: "Does this add to the user's peace of mind or detract from it?"
