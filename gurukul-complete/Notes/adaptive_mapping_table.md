# How Learning Behaviors Connect to UI Help

## The Simple Map

Student thinking deeply  
→ How I help: Gentle encouragement  
→ What it looks like: Soft blue glow that breathes  
→ Why: "You're doing great, keep going"

Hovering over choices  
→ How I help: Clear the noise  
→ What it looks like: Other elements dim, active choice glows  
→ Why: "Take your time deciding"

Clicking frantically  
→ How I help: Calm things down  
→ What it looks like: Interface becomes simpler  
→ Why: "Let's breathe for a moment"

Getting tired  
→ How I help: Suggest a break  
→ What it looks like: Warmer colors and natural pauses  
→ Why: "Rest when you need to"

Lost in navigation  
→ How I help: Show the way  
→ What it looks like: Gentle pulse indicating current position  
→ Why: "Here's where you are"

Deep in flow  
→ How I help: Protect focus  
→ What it looks like: Distractions fade away  
→ Why: "Nothing else matters right now"

## How Each Connection Works

**When someone dwells on content**
→ Gentle Encouragement pattern kicks in
→ Soft blue pulse appears (like a calm heartbeat)
→ Lasts 4 seconds, then fades naturally

**When someone hovers repeatedly**  
→ Calm Clarity pattern activates
→ Everything else gets quieter, choice gets clearer
→ Helps them think without pressure

**When I see stress signals**
→ Cognitive Relief pattern responds
→ Interface becomes simpler, more spacious
→ Gives their mind room to settle

**When fatigue shows up**
→ Rest Invitation pattern appears
→ Colors get warmer, natural break points emerge
→ Honors their learning rhythm

**When they're exploring back and forth**
→ Gentle Wayfinding pattern helps
→ Shows where they are with soft highlights
→ Supports their curiosity without judgment

**When they're deeply focused**
→ Sacred Focus pattern protects
→ Everything non-essential fades away
→ Creates a learning sanctuary

## The Rules I Follow

- Only one help at a time (no chaos)
- Always fade back to normal
- Never interrupt genuine learning
- Respect their natural pace
- Keep everything calm and warm
- If in doubt, do less not more
