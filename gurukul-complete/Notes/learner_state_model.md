# Learner State Model

## confused
Uncertain about concepts or connections, leading to unclear understanding.
- **Cognitive**: Scattered attention, cluttered mind, difficulty seeing bigger picture
- **Behavioral**: Re-reading content, long pauses, backtracking, frequent help requests
- **Risk**: MEDIUM — Natural but needs support
- **Transitions**: → focused, lost, fatigued

## focused
Fully engaged with clear understanding and steady progress.
- **Cognitive**: Steady attention, efficient processing, confident knowledge application
- **Behavioral**: Steady progress, minimal repetition, sustained engagement, accurate responses
- **Risk**: LOW — Ideal state
- **Transitions**: → flow, fatigued, confused, overloaded

## fatigued
Mental energy depleted, reducing processing ability and focus.
- **Cognitive**: Wandering attention, slower processing, less accurate understanding
- **Behavioral**: Dropping accuracy, longer response times, shorter sessions, avoiding complexity
- **Risk**: MEDIUM — Poor retention if continued
- **Transitions**: → focused, lost, overloaded

## overloaded
Overwhelmed by too much information, causing mental breakdown.
- **Cognitive**: Flooded mind, scattered attention, severely impaired understanding
- **Behavioral**: Chaotic navigation, task abandonment, many errors, random responses
- **Risk**: HIGH — Prevents learning
- **Transitions**: → confused, fatigued, lost

## lost
Disconnected from learning goals, disoriented about progress and next steps.
- **Cognitive**: Fragmented mental picture, cannot connect to goals, no clear path
- **Behavioral**: Aimless navigation, returning to start, inactivity, exit attempts
- **Risk**: HIGH — Leads to abandonment
- **Transitions**: → confused, focused

## flow
Completely absorbed with perfect challenge-skill balance and intrinsic motivation.
- **Cognitive**: Complete absorption, effortless processing, seamless integration
- **Behavioral**: Extended engagement, smooth progression, voluntary exploration
- **Risk**: LOW — Optimal state
- **Transitions**: → focused, fatigued, confused
